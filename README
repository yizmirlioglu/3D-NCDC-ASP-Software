3D-NCDC-ASP SOFTWARE:

3D-NCDC-ASP is a framework for representing and reasoning about qualitative directional relations. 3D-NCDC-ASP uses Cardinal Directional Calculus (CDC) introduced by Izmirlioglu and Erdem (2020) to represent directional relations. This framework can solve consistency checking problems in 3D-nCDC, integrate commonsense knowledge into reasoning, handle incomplete or uncertain information, infer unknown relations between objects and find a suitable configuration of objects that fulfills the given inquiry.

Features of 3D-NCDC-ASP System:
- Reason with basic and disjunctive information
- Utilize commonsense knowledge by default 3D-nCDC constraints
- Infer missing 3D cardinal directions between objects
- Alternative domains: Connected (Reg) or possibly disconnected (Reg*)

This software uses ASP programs in the thesis for reasoning with 3D-nCDC. 



REQUIREMENTS:

Python 3



USAGE:

Extract 3D-NCDC-ASP-Software.zip to a folder
Enter your 3D-NCDC constraint network into "network.txt" file according to below format
Open a Terminal from the folder
Run the command  "python3 ncdc_3d_python.py"



FORMAT OF THE "network.lp" FILE:

[Number of Objects]
[Domain]
[Constraint Type] [Target Object] [CDC Relation] [Reference Object]
[Constraint Type] [Target Object] [CDC Relation] [Reference Object]
[Constraint Type] [Target Object] [CDC Relation] [Reference Object]
...
...


[Domain]
0   Disconnected
1   Connected

[Constraint Type]
"basic"            Basic constraint
"disj"             Disjunctive constraint
"default"          Default constraint
"infer"            Infer a missing relation (only target and reference object entered, tiles are not entered)

3D-nCDC relation must be written by separating each tile by ":" without any space between them. In case of single-tile relation, ":" is not used.  Tiles are written according to below encoding:

swb: southwest-below  sb:south-below  seb:southeast-below  wb:west-below    ob:on-below   eb:east-below  nwb:northwest-below  nb:north-below  neb:northeast-below

swm: southwest-medium  sb:south-medium  seb:southeast-medium  wb:west-medium   ob:on-medium   eb:east-medium  nwb:northwest-medium  nb:north-medium  neb:northeast-medium

swa: southwest-above  sa:south-above   sea:southeast-above   wa:west-above    oa:on-above    ea:east-above    nwa:northwest-above    na:north-above  nea:northeast-above

In case of Disjunctive 3D-nCDC constraint, disjuncts are written inside curly braces, separated by "," Some space can be left between disjuncts for readability but this is not necessary. See examples



EXAMPLES:

Look at the content of example1_connected.txt, example2_connected.txt, example3_disconnected.txt, example4_disconnected.txt files for an example network file
